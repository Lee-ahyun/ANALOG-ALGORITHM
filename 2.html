 <h2>Grid System</h2>
 <p style="margin-top:25px;">In art, composition can be the basis of an art work, meaning the relationship between various graphic elements. Configuration lines are almost always partially specified. Many parts of most lines disappear as if they were below the surface of the painting, depending on the completion of the work, but they remain the overall basic framework of the image. So analysis of the composition lines of images in art history is one of the important areas. There are many works that deal with this problem clearly and logically, and recently, many artists have used grids in their works and made them appear to be sculptural elements.

   Our goal is also to isolate the grid from the image and repurpose it as a design grid. To separate formal principles between defined lines in the image, we explore the geometric circle in the picture. Here, photo images will serve as sources of design, or grid, suitable for various purposes. Photographs can be used as starting points because they include various material forms, such as objects, nature, buildings, typeboards, or simply existing logos.
</p>
<p style="margin-top:25px;">
As such, our grids are created based on the early form of photography. Designs (grids) developed in this way will be considered within a variety of graphical environments and will produce appropriate results.</p>
