 <h2>Print letters</h2>
 <p style="margin-top:25px;">The above process demonstrated the process of extracting and simplifying basic media variables of vision from various images in the environment. Based on a simplified design, we can create new graphic elements and art, and a typical example of this is letters. Today's letters appear to be a formative representation of communication, or a symbolic meaning of visual communication. Numerous letters (languages) have all the basic structures of geometric circles as a single word, of which the alphabet is the simplest yet most flexible and the most representative language of geometric circles.</p>

 <p style="margin-top:25px;">Instead of just looking at the signs and signboards that we've been looking at in our daily lives, we can develop our own character matrix and make our own fonts. To escape the rigid form and boring repetition of the existing alphabet, we must go through the process of reinventing it into an entirely new form of alphabet, which we will go back to the nature and use analog algorithms of points, lines and facets.</p>

 <p style="margin-top:25px;">Our strategy, such as above, helps us create and estimate graphical languages, bringing proportional specifications from images into the design environment. The strategy by these algorithms opens up infinite possibilities for many intermediaries, and the newly created type space will bridge the gap between the challenges that existing designers were facing in everyday tasks.</p>
