 <h2>Epiloge</h2>
 <p><strong>In <u>graphic design</u></strong>, the grid is a key part. In the grid, a constant space is divided into an array of distinct surfaces, defining the percentage of elements, such as a typeface or logo. The grid is a medium for the creative process that provides frames in which the design can be made, and the frame and its parameters function as creative catalysts for the designer.</p>
 <p style="margin-top:25px;">As a graphic designer, we would like to see the clear basis for design, namely the basic design, as a grid, and create a variety of graphic elements. In this project, the grid is viewed as a starting point and the graphic is shown in a sequentially expanding process and aims to proceed in various directions.</p>
